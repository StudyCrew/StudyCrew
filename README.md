# StudyCrew

Welcome to StudyCrew's GitHub repository! This repository serves as the central hub for our project's source code, assets, and content.

## Introduction

StudyCrew is a dedicated online platform designed to foster accessible, collaborative, and engaging educational experiences. We're committed to making learning more inclusive and interactive. If you have any questions or inquiries, feel free to reach out to us at [development@studycrew.world](mailto:development@studycrew.world).

## Getting Started

To begin, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/studycrew/studycrew
```

### Setting up MongoDB:
StudyCrew uses MongoDB as its primary data storage. Ensure you have a local instance or a free MongoDB Atlas subscription. Set your connection string in the .env.example file:

```
MONGODB_URL=[YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE]
```

### Setting up Authentication with Clerk:
For authentication, StudyCrew utilizes Clerk. To set up your local instance, you'll need a Clerk account. Once you've created an account, obtain your credentials and place them in the env.local file:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=[YOUR PUBLISHABLE KEY FROM CLERK]
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=[YOUR SECRET KEY FROM CLERK]
```

### Sentry exception handling
If you would like to handle exceptions like we do, just create a free Sentry.io account and replace the `dsn` key with your own in the following files:

1. sentry.client.config.ts
1. sentry.edge.config.ts
1. sentry.server.config.ts

Here is an example:

```typescript
import * as Sentry from '@sentry/nextjs'

Sentry.init({
	dsn: '[YOUR DSN HERE]',

	// Adjust this value in production, or use tracesSampler for greater control
	tracesSampleRate: 1,

	// Setting this option to true will print useful information
	// to the console while you're setting up Sentry.
	debug: false
})
```
### Running the project locally:

To run the project locally, you need to:

1. `pnpm i` the required dependencies.

1. `pnpm dev` to launch the development server.
