		question: 'What will be the pricing?',
		answer: `
          <span>
            As of now, we are committed to offer all features of our platform for free to ensure
            accessibility for everyone. In the future, to sustain the platform, we might have to
            introduce minimal ads or a few premium features. Rest assured, our primary goal will
            always be to keep education open and accessible to everyone, and any potential
            monetization methods will be implemented with that mission in mind.

	{
		question: 'What kind of content can I expect?',
		answer: `
          <span>
            In the beginning, we will offer learning paths that contain organized resources and
            have a community around it. Most content will come from the community - through
            contributions in study groups, shared flashcards, feedback in the feedback forum,
            and tutoring sessions. We plan to expand our content at a later stage though, and
            want to implement courses, 3D environments, and more.

		question: 'How will tutoring be offered?',
		answer: `
          <span>
            Tutoring on our platform is designed to foster a collaborative learning environment.
            We provide group tutoring sessions where participants can benefit from a structured
            learning experience led by a tutor. Importantly, this is offered at no monetary cost,
            emphasizing our commitment to accessible education for everyone.

		question: 'Will there be a mobile app?',
		answer: `
          <span>
            We are considering introducing a mobile app in stage two of our platform's development.
            However, the final decision will be largely influenced by user feedback to ensure we're
            meeting the needs and preferences of our community.

          <span>
            We will start with support for English-only in the beginning. In stage two, we will work
            on expanding our languages with the aspiration to become a global, multilingual platform.

		question: 'How do you handle user-feedback and suggestions?',

            We highly value user feedback and suggestions as they guide our platform's improvements.
            Users can discuss their insights on our Discord server, specifically in the feature-requests
            section. Alternatively, reaching out to us via email is always an option.
